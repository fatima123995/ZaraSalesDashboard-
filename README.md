# ZaraSalesAnalysis

This Excel project analyzes retail performance for Zara, focusing on factors that influence sales volume and revenue. It demonstrates data cleaning, Pivot Tables, and visual storytelling through a dashboard.

## Project Overview

The project explores how different variables such as store placement, promotions, product mix, and pricing affect Zara’s sales. The goal is to provide data-backed recommendations to increase revenue.

**Key Phases:**

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Identified and handled missing values in `Name` and `Description` columns.
- Ensured `Price` column is in USD currency format and `Sales Volume` is a whole number.
- Created a calculated column: **Total Revenue** (`Price × Sales Volume`).

### 2. Pivot Table Explorations
- **Store Layout:** Analyzed average sales volume by product position (Aisle vs Front of Store).  
- **Promotions:** Compared average sales volume for products with and without promotions.  
- **Product Mix:** Compared average price points for Men vs Women sections.

### 3. Dashboard Visualizations
- **Bar Chart:** Total Revenue by Product Type (e.g., Jackets, Sweaters).  
- **Pie Chart:** Percentage of Seasonal vs Non-Seasonal products.  
- **Scatter Plot:** Relationship between Price and Sales Volume to identify trends.



## How to Use
1. Open the Excel file: `Excel dashboard`.  
2. Explore the Pivot Tables and charts to understand insights.  
3. Modify or filter data if needed to simulate different scenarios.
